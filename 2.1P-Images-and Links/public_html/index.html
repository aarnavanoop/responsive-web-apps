    <p class = "description">For this task, I chose a theme for mountains as I love to go on hikes with my mates. We've hiked up many mountains and trails
        in Victoria like <a href = https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/mount-riddell-summit target = "_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mount Riddel</a>
         and the <a href = https://www.parks.vic.gov.au/places-to-see/parks/cathedral-range-state-park target = "blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">Cathedral Ranges</a>
    </p>
    <p class = "image-link">Although I didn't take this photo, this image shows a strong resemblance
        to what the view from atop the <a href = "#cathedral">Cathedral Ranges</a> would look like
