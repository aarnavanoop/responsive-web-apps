    <h2>A bit about me</h2>
    <p>
        <em>I'm a big fan of basketball, having played it for over 12 years</em>
        <br>
        <em>I've also developed a strong interest in coding, namely full stack development.
        I find it<strong> very </strong> fulfilling to see a webpage grow,
        and more particularly I have a keen interest in backend development and algorithms</em>            
        <br>
        <em>I'm on an academic scholarship at Deakin University and I've never been more interested
            and confident in finding a full time job after I graduate
        </em>
        <br>
        <em>There is one thing I do miss from home, having come from Singapore and that's: Singaporean Food</em>
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>One of my favourite quotes is one said by Kobe Bryant and it reads:</em>
        <blockquote>
            "Everything negative – pressure, challenges – is all an opportunity for me to rise".
            <br>
            - Kobe Bryant
        </blockquote>
        <em>It's a line I remember constantly through trials and tribulations to remind me to keep going</em>
    </p>
